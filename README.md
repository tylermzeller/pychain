# Blockchain in Python

Learning about blockchains from [Jeiwan](https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go) and porting to Python.

## DISCLAIMER
This repository is for personal experimentation and mainly for fun (you may even find a joke or two written throughout the code!). There is no set process for testing, so code in the master branch has no guarantees of running correctly.

## Current State

  * Persistence is accomplished using the [Plyvel](https://plyvel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library. Previously this was done using [shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html). Moving from Shelve to Plyvel, we lost the convenience of letting the database handle serialization of blocks, UTXOs, and wallets. However, Plyvel should be a more robust and efficient database, giving us snapshots, sorted iterators, write batches, and more!
  * Public/Private key cryptography (verifying/signing) is accomplished through the [ecdsa](https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa) library. See their README for security considerations.
  * Blocks only support PTPKH transactions. No scripting. Just locking and unlocking outputs.
  * P2P testing so far has been limited (only 4 peers, no bad actors).
  * Since block times are so low, the blockchain will often fork. The network handles this gracefully and always reaches consensus.
# Tests
See the [README](./pychain/tests/README.md) in the tests directory

## Quick Start

## Single Node Using Docker
```bash
$ docker build -t pychain .
...
# -it lets you input characters (CTRL-C, and 'q' to quit)
# --rm deletes the container upon exit (i.e. deleting your databases)
$ docker run -it --rm pychain
```

## P2P Network Using Docker-Compose
It's recommended you use the provided deployment scripts
```bash
$ cd scripts
$ ./deploy_network --num-nodes=3
```

Alternatively, you can roll your own docker-compose setup.
```bash
$ docker build -t pychain .

# you will need a valid docker-compose.yml file for this to work. You can use the template in this repo as a reference.
$ docker-compose up --scale p2p=3
```


## Node CLI
The following commands can be ran on a single Pychain node.

### Creating Wallets
